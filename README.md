## Understanding the Stellar Consensus Protocol

The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a closed system to accurately record financial transactions. SCP simultaneously enjoys four key properties: decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.
